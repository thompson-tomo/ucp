# Catalog Search Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search`

Performs a search against the business's product catalog. Supports free-text
queries, filtering by category and price, and pagination.

## Operation

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Search Catalog** | Search for products using provided inputs and filters. |

### Request

{{ extension_schema_fields('catalog_search.json#/$defs/search_request', 'catalog') }}

### Response

{{ extension_schema_fields('catalog_search.json#/$defs/search_response', 'catalog') }}

## Search Inputs

A valid search request MUST include at least one of: a `query` string,
one or more `filters`, or an extension-defined input. When `query` is
omitted, the request represents a browse operation — the business returns
products matching the provided filters without text-relevance ranking.
Extensions MAY define additional inputs (e.g., visual similarity,
product references).

Implementations MUST validate that incoming requests contain at least one
recognized input and SHOULD reject empty or invalid requests with an
appropriate error. Implementations define and enforce their own rules for
input presence and content — for example, requiring `query`, rejecting
empty `query` strings, or accepting filter-only requests for category browsing.

## Search Filters

Filter criteria for narrowing search results. Standard filters are defined below;
merchants MAY support additional custom filters via `additionalProperties`.

### Price Filter

{{ schema_fields('types/price_filter', 'catalog') }}

## Pagination

Cursor-based pagination for list operations. Cursors are opaque strings
that implementations MAY encode as stateless keyset tokens.

### Page Size

The `limit` parameter is a requested page size, not a guaranteed count.
Implementations SHOULD accept a page size of at least 10. When the
requested limit exceeds the implementation's maximum, implementations
MAY clamp to their maximum silently — returning fewer results without
error. Clients MUST NOT assume the response size equals the requested limit.

### Pagination Request

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/request', 'catalog') }}

### Pagination Response

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/response', 'catalog') }}
