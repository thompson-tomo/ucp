# Fulfillment Extension

## Overview

The fulfillment extension enables businesses to advertise support for physical
goods fulfillment (shipping, pickup, etc).

This extension adds a `fulfillment` field to Checkout and/or Catalog:

* **Checkout** (`dev.ucp.shopping.checkout`) — selection and cost: which
    items go where, by which method, at what price and ETA.
* **Catalog** (`dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search` and
    `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.lookup`) — discovery: a variant advertises the
    fulfillment options available for it, based on the provided buyer
    context. See [Catalog Discovery](#catalog-discovery).

On Checkout, the `fulfillment` field contains:

* `methods[]` — fulfillment methods applicable to cart items (shipping, pickup, etc.)
    * `line_item_ids` — which items this method fulfills
    * `destinations[]` — where to fulfill (address, store location)
    * `groups[]` — business-generated packages, each with selectable `options[]`
* `available_methods[]` — inventory availability per item (optional)

**Mental model:**

* `methods[0]` Shipping
    * `line_item_ids` 👕👖
    * `selected_destination_id` = `destinations[0].id` 🔘✅ 123 Fake St
    * `groups[0]` 📦👕👖
        * `selected_option_id` = `options[0].id` 🔘✅ Standard $5
        * `options[1]` 🔘 Express $10
* `methods[1]` Pick Up in Store
    * `line_item_ids` 👞
    * `selected_destination_id` = `destinations[0].id` 🔘✅ Uptown Store
    * `groups[0]` 📦👞
        * `selected_option_id` = `options[0].id` 🔘✅ In-Store Pickup
        * `options[1]` 🔘 Curbside Pickup

## Schema

Fulfillment applies only to items requiring physical delivery. Items not
requiring fulfillment (e.g., digital goods) do not need to be assigned to a
method.

    ]
  }
}
```

## Rendering

Fulfillment options are designed for **method-agnostic rendering**. Platforms
do not need to understand specific method types (shipping, pickup, etc.) to
present options meaningfully. The business provides precomputed,
human-readable fields that platforms render directly.

### Human-Readable Fields

| Location              | Field         | Required | Purpose                                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `title`       | Yes      | Primary label that distinguishes from siblings          |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `description` | No       | Supplementary context for the title                     |
| `groups[].options[]`  | `totals`      | Yes      | Cost breakdown: an array of `total` objects             |
| `available_methods[]` | `description` | No       | Standalone explanation of alternative availability      |

### Business Responsibilities

**For `options[].title`:**

* **MUST** distinguish this option from its siblings
* **SHOULD** include method and speed (e.g., "Express Shipping", "Curbside Pickup")
* **MUST** be sufficient for buyer decision if `description` is absent

**For `options[].description`:**

* **MUST NOT** repeat `title` or `total`—provides supplementary context only
* **SHOULD** include timing, carrier, or other decision-relevant details
* **SHOULD** be a complete phrase (e.g., "Arrives Dec 12-15 via FedEx")
* **MAY** be omitted if title is self-explanatory

**For `available_methods[].description`:**

* **MUST** be a standalone sentence explaining what, when, and where
* **SHOULD** be usable verbatim in platform dialogue (e.g., "Pants available
    for pickup at Downtown Store today at 2pm")

**For ordering:**

* Businesses **SHOULD** return `options[]` in a meaningful order (e.g., cheapest
    first, fastest first)
* Platforms **SHOULD** preserve that order, but **MAY** re-order it
    (e.g. to match known buyer preferences or surface-specific ranking);
    they **MUST** preserve the method/option grouping

### Platform Responsibilities

Platforms **SHOULD** treat fulfillment as a generic, renderable structure:

* Render each option as a card using `title`, `description`, and `total`
* Present all methods returned—method selection is a buyer decision
* Preserve the method and option structure—do not merge or de-duplicate;
    the platform chooses ordering
* Use `available_methods[].description` to surface alternatives to the buyer

Platforms **MAY** provide enhanced UX for recognized method types (store
selectors
for pickup, carrier logos for shipping), but this is optional. The baseline
contract is: **`title` + `description` + `total` is sufficient to render any
option.**

When a buyer selects an option the platform cannot fully process, the
platform **SHOULD** use `continue_url` to hand off to the business's checkout.

## Available Methods

Available methods indicate whether an item can be fulfilled with a given
method, and when. Use cases:

* **Alternative methods**: "These pants are also available for pickup at Downtown Store"
* **Fulfill later**: Preorders, items shipping from a distant warehouse, pickup when store gets inventory

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/checkout op=read -->
```json
{
  "ucp": { ... },
  "id": "...",
  "status": "...",
  "currency": "...",
  "line_items": [ ... ],
  "totals": [ ... ],
  "links": [ ... ],
  "fulfillment": {
    "methods": [
      {
        "id": "shipping",
        "type": "shipping",
        "line_item_ids": ["shirt", "pants"]
      },
      {
        "id": "pickup",
        "type": "pickup",
        "line_item_ids": []
      }
    ],
    "available_methods": [
      {
        "type": "shipping",
        "line_item_ids": ["shirt", "pants"],
        "fulfillable_on": "now"
      },
      {
        "type": "pickup",
        "line_item_ids": ["pants"],
        "fulfillable_on": "2026-12-01T10:00:00Z",
        "description": "Available for pickup at Downtown Store today at 2pm"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `description` field enables platforms to surface alternatives to buyers:

> 🤖 The shirt and pants ship for $5, arriving in 5-8 days. Or the pants can
> be picked up at Downtown Store in 4 hours.

If the buyer chooses pickup but the platform doesn't support split
fulfillment, the platform **SHOULD** use `continue_url` to hand off to the
business's checkout.

## Catalog Discovery

When the fulfillment extension extends the Catalog capability, each variant
in a catalog response carries a `fulfillment` object listing the fulfillment
methods available for that variant and their availability — so a buyer
browsing the catalog can see how an item can be fulfilled.

### Methods

`fulfillment.methods[]` lists the methods available for a variant. Each
method has:

* `type` — the fulfillment method (e.g. `shipping`, `pickup`); see
    [Method Types](#method-types).
* `description` — short, buyer-facing summary of how the variant is
    fulfilled via this method (e.g. "Ships in 2–4 business days"). Directly
    renderable; see [Rendering](#rendering).
* `availability` — whether the variant is available via this method at the
    specified or inferred location.
* `location` — for place-based methods (e.g. `pickup`), the resolved
    location id, and the business's stable identifier for that location. A
    business that advertises pickup at a `location` MUST accept the same id
    as `selected_destination_id` for that method, so a discovered location
    can be used in cart and checkout.
* `options` — concrete fulfillment choices within this method (e.g.
    Standard, Express); see [Options](#options). Optional.

Catalog reports availability for a single location per method — the one
specified via `fulfills_to` or inferred from `context`; discovering and
comparing other locations is handled separately.

The variant-level `availability` indicates whether the variant is
obtainable via *any* method; a method's own `availability` is authoritative
for that method. Where a method states `availability`, consumers MUST use
it for that method and MUST NOT infer per-method availability from the
variant-level value.

### Options

A method MAY carry `options[]`, a representative subset of its fulfillment
options — not an exhaustive list. Without a destination or full cart,
catalog SHOULD preview meaningful boundary options for the buyer (e.g.
cheapest, fastest); the full, high-resolution set is negotiated in cart and
checkout once those are known.

Each option carries an `id` and a `title` (a short label distinguishing it
from siblings), plus an optional renderable `description` for context. These
are a shared base: at checkout the same option is composed with cost and
timing (`totals`, carrier, fulfillment times). The option is open, so a
business MAY annotate it with additional fields. A method MAY also carry
none, surfacing only `type`, `description`, and `availability`; options are
nested directly under the method, with no group layer (unlike checkout
`methods[].groups[].options[]`).

A discovered option `id` lets a buyer's choice carry forward: a business
SHOULD accept the same id as `selected_option_id` in cart and checkout.
The id is a best-effort handle, not a guaranteed match — an option
discovered for a single product may differ in a cart, where other
products, quantities, and combined fulfillment modify the options.

#### Availability

{{ schema_fields('types/availability', 'fulfillment') }}

#### Fulfillment Destination Filter

{{ schema_fields('types/fulfillment_destination_filter', 'fulfillment') }}

### Location and method: `context` and `filters`

* **`context`** (`address_country` / `address_region` / `postal_code`) is
    where the *buyer* is — a non-binding hint the business uses to report
    `availability`. On a market-scoped catalog it MAY narrow results;
    otherwise it annotates rather than removes them.
* **`filters.fulfills_to`** is where the order is *fulfilled to* — a single
    destination, named by value (a coarse address: `address_country` /
    `address_region` / `postal_code`) or by reference (a `location` id — a
    store, pickup point, or saved address). Platforms **SHOULD** provide one
    or the other, not both; if both are present, a business **SHOULD** use
    the more specific — typically `location`. It restricts results to what
    can be fulfilled there and seeds method `availability`, and may differ
    from `context` (e.g. a gift).
* **`filters.methods`** restricts results to specific method types (e.g.
    `["pickup"]`).

Provide location once: `context` for where the buyer is, `fulfills_to` for
an explicit destination. When both are present, `fulfills_to` supersedes
`context`.

### Example

A variant exposes two fulfillment methods: shipping to the buyer's ship-to
and pickup today at a named store. Each method carries its own availability,
and `pickup` references the resolved location by id.

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/fulfillment def=fulfillment_search_response op=read -->
```json
{
  "ucp": { "version": "{{ ucp_version }}" },
  "products": [
    {
      "id": "prod_kettle",
      "title": "Electric Kettle",
      "description": { "plain": "1.7L electric kettle." },
      "price_range": {
        "min": { "amount": 4999, "currency": "USD" },
        "max": { "amount": 4999, "currency": "USD" }
      },
      "variants": [
        {
          "id": "var_ss",
          "title": "Stainless Steel",
          "description": { "plain": "Stainless steel finish." },
          "price": { "amount": 4999, "currency": "USD" },
          "availability": { "available": true, "status": "in_stock" },
          "fulfillment": {
            "methods": [
              {
                "type": "shipping",
                "description": { "plain": "Ships to your address in 1–4 business days" },
                "availability": { "available": true, "status": "in_stock" },
                "options": [
                  {
                    "id": "std",
                    "title": "Standard",
                    "description": { "plain": "Arrives in 4 business days" }
                  },
                  {
                    "id": "exp",
                    "title": "Express",
                    "description": { "plain": "Next business day" }
                  }
                ]
              },
              {
                "type": "pickup",
                "description": { "plain": "Pickup today at Downtown Store" },
                "location": "loc_downtown",
                "availability": { "available": true, "status": "in_stock" }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Each method is a way the variant can be fulfilled, with its own
`availability`. Each method's `description` is directly renderable, so a
platform can present it without recognizing the `type` (see
[Rendering](#rendering)). The shipping method's `description` previews the
delivery range, and its `options[]` refine it (Standard, Express); pickup
carries none — `options` is optional.

## Configuration

Businesses and platforms declare fulfillment constraints in their profiles.
Businesses fetch platform profiles to adapt responses accordingly.

The `extends` array lists the capabilities this extension adds fulfillment
to. Checkout is the authoritative, transactional surface; catalog is for
discovery. A business lists the catalog capabilities in `extends` to expose
fulfillment on catalog, or omits them to scope itself to checkout only.

### Platform Profile

Platforms declare their rendering capabilities using `platform_schema`:

{{ schema_fields('types/platform_fulfillment_config', 'fulfillment') }}

Platforms that omit config or set `supports_multi_group: false` receive
single-group responses. The response shape is always
`methods[].groups[]`—the difference is whether `groups.length` can exceed 1
within each method.

Default declaration (single group per method; fulfillment surfaced on
checkout and on catalog discovery):

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=platform_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": [
        "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.lookup"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

A party that does not expose catalog discovery MAY narrow `extends` to
`"dev.ucp.shopping.checkout"` (string form) or to a single-element array.

Opt-in declaration (business MAY return multiple groups per method):

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=platform_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": [
        "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.lookup"
      ],
      "config": { "supports_multi_group": true }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Business Profile

Businesses declare what fulfillment configurations they support using
`merchant_config`:

{{ schema_fields('types/merchant_fulfillment_config', 'fulfillment') }}

<!-- ucp:example schema=profile def=business_schema target=$.ucp.capabilities -->
```json
{
  "dev.ucp.shopping.fulfillment": [
    {
      "version": "{{ ucp_version }}",
      "spec": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/specification/fulfillment",
      "schema": "https://ucp.dev/{{ ucp_version }}/schemas/shopping/fulfillment.json",
      "extends": [
        "dev.ucp.shopping.checkout",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.search",
        "dev.ucp.shopping.catalog.lookup"
      ],
      "config": {
        "multi_destination": [
          { "method": "shipping" }
        ],
        "method_combinations": [["shipping", "pickup"]]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This example says: shipping can go to multiple addresses, and carts can mix
shipping+pickup.

### Business Response Behavior

**When `supports_multi_group: false` (default):**

* Business **MUST** consolidate all items into a **single group per method**
* Response still uses array structure: `methods[].groups[]` with `groups.length === 1`
* Business **MAY** still return multiple methods (e.g., shipping + pickup) if
    cart items require it

**When `supports_multi_group: true`:**

* Business **MAY** return multiple groups per method based on inventory,
    packaging, or warehouse logic
* Platform is responsible for rendering group selection UI (e.g., choose
    shipping speed per package)

### Method Types

`fulfillment_method.type` (checkout) and `catalog_fulfillment_method.type`
(catalog) share one open-string vocabulary. Presentation is method-agnostic:
platforms **SHOULD** present every method, rendering `description` and
`availability` regardless of its `type` (see [Rendering](#rendering)), and
**SHOULD NOT** omit a method solely because they do not recognize its `type`.
Recognizing a `type` only enables optional type-specific UX.

A method is identified by its `type` and its fulfillment scope (what it
fulfills and where). A business **SHOULD** model same-scope variation (e.g.
Standard vs Express) as `options`, and **SHOULD NOT** emit multiple methods
that differ only in option-level detail. Same-`type` methods are valid when
their scope differs — e.g. checkout may carry two `shipping` methods to
different destinations. In catalog a method covers a single variant at one
resolved location, so this collapses to at most one method per `type`.

**Well-known values:**

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `shipping` | Carrier ships to the buyer's address. |
| `pickup` | Buyer picks up at a named location. |
| `curbside` | Buyer picks up at a location without leaving their vehicle (drive-up). |

**Adding method types.** Because `type` is an open string, a business MAY
introduce a new value at any time with no consumer change: it advertises the
value (and filters on it via `filters.methods`), and consumers present it
like any other method.

**Example — adding `home_installation`.** No schema change or registration is
needed. Emit the value directly as the `type` on catalog and checkout, and
filter with `filters.methods: ["home_installation"]`. For cart and checkout
negotiation, declare its behavior in the business profile `config` — e.g.
include `["shipping", "home_installation"]` in `method_combinations`
so a cart can mix shipped and installed items (see
[Business Profile](#business-profile)). On a catalog variant's method:

<!-- ucp:example schema=shopping/fulfillment def=catalog_fulfillment_method op=read -->
```json
{
  "type": "home_installation",
  "description": { "plain": "Delivered and installed in your home" },
  "availability": {
    "available": true
  }
}
```

## Examples

### Split Groups

**Config:** Platform profile requires `config.supports_multi_group: true`

Business splits items into multiple packages; buyer selects shipping rate per
package.

### Split Destinations

**Config:** Business profile lists `shipping` in `config.multi_destination`

Shirt ships to mom (US), pants ship to grandma (Hong Kong). Two methods of the
same type, each with its own destination.
