# Catalog Capability

* **Capability Name:** `dev.ucp.shopping.catalog`
* **Version:** `DRAFT`

## Overview

Allows platforms to search and browse business product catalogs. This capability
enables product discovery before checkout, supporting use cases like:

* Free-text product search
* Category and filter-based browsing
* Direct product/variant retrieval by ID
* Price comparison across variants

**Key Concepts**

* **Product**: A catalog entry with title, description, media, and one or more
  variants.
* **Variant**: A purchasable SKU with specific option selections (e.g., "Blue /
  Large"), price, and availability.
* **Price**: Price values include both amount (in minor currency units) and
  currency code, enabling multi-currency catalogs.

**Relationship to Checkout**

Catalog operations return product and variant IDs that can be used directly in
checkout `line_items[].item.id`. The variant ID from catalog retrieval should match
the item ID expected by checkout.

## Operations

The Catalog capability defines the following logical operations.

| Operation | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Search Catalog** | Search for products using query text and filters. |
| **Get Catalog Item** | Retrieve a specific product or variant by ID. |

### Search Catalog

Performs a search against the business's product catalog. Supports free-text
queries, filtering by category and price, and pagination.

**Use Cases:**

* User searches for "blue running shoes"
* Agent browses products in a category
* Platform fetches featured or trending products

{{ method_fields('search_catalog', 'rest.openapi.json', 'catalog') }}

### Get Catalog Item

Retrieves a specific product or variant by its Global ID (GID). Use this when
you already have an ID (e.g., from a saved list, deep link, or cart validation).

**Use Cases:**

* Validating cart items before checkout
* Fetching full product details from a product ID
* Resolving variant details for display

**ID Resolution Behavior:**

The `id` parameter accepts either a product ID or variant ID. The response MUST
return the parent product with full context (title, description, media, options):

* **Product ID lookup**: `variants` MAY contain a representative set.
* **Variant ID lookup**: `variants` MUST contain only the requested variant.

When the full variant set is large, a representative set MAY be returned based on
buyer context or other criteria. This ensures agents always have product context
for display while getting exactly what they requested.

{{ method_fields('get_catalog_item', 'rest.openapi.json', 'catalog') }}

## Entities

### Context

Location and market context for catalog operations. All fields are optional. Platforms MAY geo-detect context from request IP/headers. When context fields are provided, they MUST override any auto-detected values.

{{ extension_schema_fields('catalog.json#/$defs/context', 'catalog') }}

### Product

A catalog entry representing a sellable item with one or more purchasable variants.

`media` and `variants` are ordered arrays. Businesses SHOULD return the featured
image and default variant as the first element. Platforms SHOULD treat the first
element as the featured item for display.

{{ schema_fields('types/product', 'catalog') }}

### Variant

A purchasable SKU with specific option selections, price, and availability.

`media` is an ordered array. Businesses SHOULD return the featured variant image
as the first element. Platforms SHOULD treat the first element as featured.

{{ schema_fields('types/variant', 'catalog') }}

### Price

{{ schema_fields('types/price', 'catalog') }}

### Price Range

{{ schema_fields('types/price_range', 'catalog') }}

### Media

{{ schema_fields('types/media', 'catalog') }}

### Product Option

{{ schema_fields('types/product_option', 'catalog') }}

### Option Value

{{ schema_fields('types/option_value', 'catalog') }}

### Selected Option

{{ schema_fields('types/selected_option', 'catalog') }}

### Rating

{{ schema_fields('types/rating', 'catalog') }}

### Search Filters

Filter criteria for narrowing search results. Standard filters are defined below;
merchants MAY support additional custom filters via `additionalProperties`.

{{ schema_fields('types/search_filters', 'catalog') }}

### Price Filter

{{ schema_fields('types/price_filter', 'catalog') }}

### Pagination

Cursor-based pagination for list operations.

#### Pagination Request

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/request', 'catalog') }}

#### Pagination Response

{{ extension_schema_fields('types/pagination.json#/$defs/response', 'catalog') }}

## Messages and Error Handling

All catalog responses include an optional `messages` array that allows businesses
to provide context about errors, warnings, or informational notices.

### Message Types

Messages communicate business outcomes and provide context:

| Type | When to Use | Example Codes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `error` | Business-level errors | `NOT_FOUND`, `OUT_OF_STOCK`, `REGION_RESTRICTED` |
| `warning` | Important conditions affecting purchase | `DELAYED_FULFILLMENT`, `FINAL_SALE`, `AGE_RESTRICTED` |
| `info` | Additional context without issues | `PROMOTIONAL_PRICING`, `LIMITED_AVAILABILITY` |

**Note**: All catalog errors use `severity: "recoverable"` - agents handle them programmatically (retry, inform user, show alternatives).

#### Message (Error)

{{ schema_fields('types/message_error', 'catalog') }}

#### Message (Warning)

{{ schema_fields('types/message_warning', 'catalog') }}

#### Message (Info)

{{ schema_fields('types/message_info', 'catalog') }}

### Common Scenarios

**Empty Search**

When search finds no matches, return an empty array without messages.

```json
{
  "ucp": {...},
  "products": []
}
```

This is not an error—the query was valid but returned no results.

**Backorder Warning**

When a product is available but has delayed fulfillment, return the product with a warning message. Use the `path` field to target specific variants.

```json
{
  "ucp": {...},
  "product": {
    "id": "prod_xyz789",
    "title": "Professional Chef Knife Set",
    "variants": [
      {
        "id": "var_abc",
        "title": "12-piece Set",
        "description": { "plain": "Complete professional knife collection." },
        "price": { "amount": 29900, "currency": "USD" },
        "availability": { "available": true }
      }
    ]
  },
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "warning",
      "code": "DELAYED_FULFILLMENT",
      "path": "$.product.variants[0]",
      "content": "12-piece set on backorder, ships in 2-3 weeks"
    }
  ]
}
```

Agents can present the option and inform the user about the delay. The `path` field uses RFC 9535 JSONPath to target specific components.

**Product Not Found**

When a requested product/variant ID doesn't exist, return success with an error message and omit the `product` field.

```json
{
  "ucp": {...},
  "messages": [
    {
      "type": "error",
      "code": "NOT_FOUND",
      "content": "The requested product ID does not exist",
      "severity": "recoverable"
    }
  ]
}
```

Agents should handle this gracefully (e.g., ask user for a different product).

## Transport Bindings

The abstract operations above are bound to specific transport protocols as
defined below:

* [REST Binding](catalog-rest.md): RESTful API mapping.
* [MCP Binding](catalog-mcp.md): Model Context Protocol mapping via JSONRPC.
